🔎 Key Questions

How do users’ activity levels compare to recommended health standards?

What patterns exist in daily steps, calories, and sedentary minutes?

How do sleep patterns align with recommended 7–8 hours?

Are there differences between weekday and weekend activity?

What marketing opportunities can Bellabeat explore based on user behavior?
